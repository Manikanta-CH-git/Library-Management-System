## Overview

This folder contains the User Interface (UI) code for the Library Management System. The goal is to provide a functional interface for managing book circulation and administrative tasks.

## Key Frontend Pages

The application is built around the following pages:

1.  **`index.html` (or `LoginPage.js`):** The primary page for **Librarian Login**.
2.  **`catalog.html` (or `BookCatalog.js`):** Displays the searchable **Book Catalog** and book availability.
3.  **`admin-dashboard.html`:** The administrative hub for:
    * **Book Management** (Add, Edit, Delete)
    * **Member Management** (Registration, Editing)
4.  **`circulation.html`:** Dedicated page for performing **Issue and Return** transactions.
5.  **`reports.html`:** Shows administrative data, like the **Defaulter List** (overdue books).
